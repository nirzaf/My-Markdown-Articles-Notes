A Hashtable is a collection of key/value pairs that are arranged based on the hash code of the key. Or in other words, a Hashtable is used to create a collection which uses a hash table for storage. It is the non-generic type of collection which is defined in _System.Collections_ namespace. In Hashtable, key objects must be immutable as long as they are used as keys in the Hashtable.
